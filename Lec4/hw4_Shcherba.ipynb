    "   - HashJoin: default choice for large joins with equality conditions.\n",
    "   - NestLoop: for small inner tables or very selective index lookups.\n",
    "   - MergeJoin: when sorted inputs or range conditions make it appropriate.\n",
    "   - No*Join: use to exclude a join type that does not fit the given scenario.\n",
    "7. Leading:\n",
    "   - Use to enforce a reasonable join order:\n",
    "     start with the most selective or smallest relations,\n",
    "     join larger fact tables later.\n",

    "   - Do NOT add hints that you are not confident in.\n",

    "   - Output exactly ONE pg_hint_plan comment.\n",
    "   - Format: `/*+ HINT1(...) HINT2(...) ... */`\n",
    "   - Hints are separated by a single space.\n",
    "   - NO additional text, NO explanation, NO SQL, NO markdown.\n",
    "   - The output MUST match the allowed syntax so that it is valid\n",
